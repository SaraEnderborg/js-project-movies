# Sara and Marinas Movie app

Description: This project is a responsive movie app built with React. The app shows a list of popular movies and allows users to click on a movie-card to view details on the specific movie.

# What we practiced

- We practiced using React Router, building a two-page app.
- Fetching data from an external API
- Working with state and effects in React
- Applying Accessibility
- Working with pair programming

* We started the project by working together, setting up a structure, how we wanted to divide the work and how we wanted to design it. We split the two pages between us and worked on them separately. Finally we merges the pages together.
* We are well aware that we forgot to commit, hence only one commit. But our work should still be traceable in our various files. We will take this with us to the next project, to be more careful with committing.
